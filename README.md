# Web Chat Application
## Objective
- To create a web chat application based on Socket.io/WebSocket/WebRTC.
- The application should be built using either the MERN or MEAN stack.
- The web application should facilitate two-way real-time communication between two parties.

## Deliverables
- **Real-Time Communication:** The app should enable real-time two-way communication without any delay, using socket connections instead of HTTP requests.
- **Online Status:** The app should show the online status of the recipient.
- **Styling and Animations:** You are free to style the app as you like. Better animations will be a plus point.
- **Responsive Design:** The web application should be responsive, considering mobile and tablet screen sizes.
- **Load Previous Messages:** The user should be able to load previous chat messages.

## Bonus Points
- **Search Contacts:** I have also include search contacts in my chat app by filtering contacts username.
- **Edit and Delete Messages:** Implementing features to delete and edit messages will earn additional points.
- **Efficiency:** More points will be awarded if the code demonstrates better time-space complexity.
- **Coding Standards:** Plus points for following good naming conventions, abstraction, and SOLID principles.
- **Message Delivery Status:** Implementing a feature to indicate if the recipient has read the message will also earn extra points.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, Socket.io, MongoDB
- **Frontend:** React (for MERN stack) or Angular (for MEAN stack)
- **Real-Time Communication:** Socket.io/WebSocket/WebRTC
